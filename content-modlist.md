# Modlist
This is a list of all the mods in this modpack and what rough category they fit into. Do not look through this modlist if you do not want to be spoiled for the modpack

## QOL
- AppleSkin
- Controlling
- Enchant Descriptions
- Jade
- JEI
- Mouse Tweaks
- Polymorph

## Content
- Farmer's Delight
- MmmMmmMmmMmm (Target Dummy)
- Sleep Tight
- ParCool!

## Server side content
- Easy NPC
- Fancy Menu

## Make game run better
- Clumps
- FerriteCore
- ImmediatelyFast
- LC2H (Lost Cityies: Multithreaded)

## Terrain Generation
- Lost City
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-lost-cities-autogen
    - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chaoszpack-lostcities
        - Might be worth it but doesn't really change lost cities besides a pallet swap and some loot tables from the looks of it
        - Has 1 mod that generates new structures that might be worth adding just on its own without this one

- biome's o plenty

## Atmosphere/vibe

## Maybe
- Epic Fight
    - Depends on if the gun mod I go for works with it or against it
- wastify
    - Hard limits what biomes can spawn as well as what blocks I don't want to spawn in a world

## Look into
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chaoszpack-lostcities

## Remaining ideas to implement
- Gun's
    - Don't use Point Blank
- Modern Armour
    - Whatever is picked is going to probably be heavily modified anyways
- Dungeons
    - Avoid high fantasy but keep in mind this is not a zombie pack as well
- Horror mods
    - Atmosphere
    - Mobs
- Hordes
    - This one might not be worth it depending on the horror mods
- Temperature
- Weather
    - Maybe more extreme like tornados and whatever but also might not be worth it
- Backpack
    - VERY basic backpack mod
        - Avoid mods that add to many upgrades to backpacks and try to find something a bit more unique
- Thirst*
    - Still up in the air about this one
        - Sanity is also probably going to be added so try not to over add things to worry about
- Diet
    - Depending on how thirst ends up being maybe make it only good so its not another thing to worry about




# TO DO LIST (in no general order)
- Actually upload files to github 
- Get custom city gen to work using the mod that is listed above (ChaosZPack) or https://modrinth.com/mod/pomkots-world
    - Disabled biomes o plenty temp to test if thats why custom city isn't generating
- Add horror mods
- Add more guns
- Add ambience mods
    - Music, Texture, Shaders, Animations
- Add late game stuff
    - tech
    - maybe some sort of hybrid future magic tech
- Customize gun mod recipes
    - remove them almost entirly and make it so you have to buy most guns and it is really hard to craft the others
