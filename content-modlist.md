## Remaining ideas to implement
- Gun's
    - Don't use Point Blank
- Modern Armour
    - Whatever is picked is going to probably be heavily modified anyways
- Dungeons
    - Avoid high fantasy but keep in mind this is not a zombie pack as well
- Horror mods
    - Atmosphere
    - Mobs
- Hordes
    - This one might not be worth it depending on the horror mods
- Temperature
- Weather
    - Maybe more extreme like tornados and whatever but also might not be worth it
- Backpack
    - VERY basic backpack mod
        - Avoid mods that add to many upgrades to backpacks and try to find something a bit more unique
- Thirst*
    - Still up in the air about this one
        - Sanity is also probably going to be added so try not to over add things to worry about
- Diet
    - Depending on how thirst ends up being maybe make it only good so its not another thing to worry about
